### CAdroid

This app is intended to assist you in importing your self-signed certificate to your Android device.

Download:

* [Download on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.cadroid)
* [Will be available on F-Droid soon.](https://f-droid.org/forums/topic/cadroid/)

        
### How does it work?
        
After you enter the host name of your HTTPS site, its certificate will be
extracted and shown to you. Possible mistakes that may prevent successful import
will be detected and displayed. As soon as you have verified the certificate by
its details and fingerprints, it will be exported into a .crt file.
        
You can then simply import the certificate from the file with a few clicks.
        
When the certificate was imported correctly, it will be accepted in (nearly) all
apps, including [DAVdroid](http://davdroid.bitfire.at) and the Android email app
([don't choose "Accept all certificates" there](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=67038)).
