        <h1>Welcome to CAdroid!</h1>
        
        <p>This app is intended to assist you in importing your self-signed certificate
        to your Android device.</p>
        
        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        
        <p>After you enter the host name of your HTTPS site, its certificate will be
        extracted and shown to you. Possible mistakes that may prevent successful import
        will be detected and displayed. As soon as you have verified the certificate by
        its details and fingerprints, it will be exported into a .crt file.</p>
        
        <p>You can then simply import the certificate from the file with a few clicks.</p>
        
        <p>When the certificate was imported correctly, it will be accepted in (nearly) all
        apps, including <a href="http://davdroid.bitfire.at">DAVdroid</a> and the
        Android email app (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=67038">don\'t
        choose \"Accept all certificates\" there</a>).</p>

        Galaxy Note 10.1/Android 4.1 doesn\'t work while CyanogenMod 11/Android 4.4 always does). Make sure
        you have set the \"CA flag\" when the certificate is generated because Android requires it! If it is not
        set correctly, Android will import the certificate without error, but it won\'t appear in the list.</string>

        <p>The certificate has been stored on your "external storage". Now you can import it to
        your Android device using Android Settings (Security):</p>
        
        <p>1. Click \"Open Settings\" to open Android Settings.</p>
        <p>2. Scroll down to \"Credential Storage\".</p>
        <p>3. Use \"Install from SD card\" (the exact term may differ) and follow the instructions.</p>
        <p>Note 1: You will have to set up a PIN or password for the lock screen
        (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=31101">Android bug #31101</a>).</p>
        <p>Note 2: On Android 4.4+, there will be a strange \"Network may be monitored\" warning
        (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=62644">Android bug #62644</a>).</p>
        
        <p>4. After installing the certificate, you can verify whether it worked by using \"Trusted credentials
        (Display trusted CA certificates)\" in Settings (Security). Your self-signed CA should appear in the \"User\"
        tab. Congratulations!</p>
