CAdroid is intended to assist you in importing your own CA or self-signed certificate
to your Android device.

**This app is _not_ required to use self-signed or custom certificates with [DAVdroid](https://davdroid.bitfire.at)!**

### Download

* [Download APK directly from Github](https://github.com/bitfireAT/cadroid/releases/latest)
* [Download from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/app/at.bitfire.cadroid)
* [Download from Amazon App Store](http://www.amazon.com/bitfire-web-engineering-CAdroid-Certificates/dp/B00P2S3ALG)
* [Download from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.cadroid)

        
### How does it work?
 
After you enter the host name of your HTTPS site, the certificate chain will be
fetched and you can select the root certificate to import. Possible import issues
will be detected and displayed.

As soon as you have verified the certificate by its details and fingerprints,
it will be exported into a .crt file. You can then simply import the certificate from the file with a few clicks.

When the certificate was imported correctly, it will be accepted in (nearly) all
apps, including [DAVdroid](https://davdroid.bitfire.at) and the Android email app
([don't choose "Accept all certificates" there](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=67038)).
