Possible mistakes that may prevent successful import\r\nwill be detected and displayed. As soon as you have verified the certificate by\r\nits details and fingerprints, it will be exported into a .crt file.\r\n        \r\nYou can then simply import the certificate from the file with a few clicks.\r\n        \r\nWhen the certificate was imported correctly, it will be accepted in (nearly) all\r\napps, including [DAVdroid](http://davdroid.bitfire.at) and the Android email app\r\n([don't choose \"Accept all certificates\" there](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=67038)).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Donations\r\n\r\nAs this software is free and open-source software, we're asking for donations.\r\nPlease see http://davdroid.bitfire.at/donate for details.\r\n\r\n        \r\n### Further info\r\n\r\n* [CAdroid home page](http://cadroid.bitfire.at)\r\n* [Github page](https://github.com/bitfireAT/cadroid) (source code, issues)\r\n        \r\nCopyright (c) 2013 â€“ 2014 Ricki Hirner ([bitfire web engineering](http://www.bitfire.at)).
